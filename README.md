# 🔐 Password Strength Assessor Tool

Welcome to the **Password Strength Assessor** – a simple Python tool that helps you understand how strong your password really is! 💪

---

## 🎯 Objective

Your task is to **build a tool** that checks how strong a password is based on these rules:

✔️ Is it long enough?  
✔️ Does it use UPPERCASE letters?  
✔️ Does it include lowercase letters?  
✔️ Are there numbers in it?  
✔️ Does it have special characters like `@`, `#`, `$`, `!`, etc.?

Each rule your password meets gives it a point. The higher the score, the stronger the password! 🔐

---

## 🧠 How It Works

The program looks at your password and gives you:
- A **score** out of 5 🎯  
- A **strength label** (like "Weak", "Strong", etc.) 📊  
- **Helpful suggestions** to make it better 🛠️

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

You only need **Python 3.x** installed.  
No extra libraries required — just pure Python!

To check if Python is installed:

```bash
python --version
